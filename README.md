## Project-4: Host a Dynamic Website on AWS Platform with Docker, ECR, and ECS
Welcome to this project, where we dive into the world of containerization and orchestration on AWS. This project guides you through leveraging Docker, Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR), and Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) to host a dynamic website. By containerizing your application and deploying it on ECS, you'll achieve scalability, reliability, and ease of management. Join us on this journey to unlock the power of containerized deployments on AWS!

Project Overview

### Introduction
What is Docker and Containerization?
Docker is a powerful tool used for containerization, which serves as a lightweight alternative to full machine virtualization. Containers allow you to package an application along with its dependencies into a standardized unit for software development. This ensures that the application runs consistently across different computing environments.

## Why Use Docker and Containers for Hosting a Website?

1. Deploying a website on a traditional EC2 instance involves managing various dependencies, libraries, and configurations, which can be complex and error-prone. Docker containers encapsulate your application and its environment, making it portable and easy to deploy. Benefits of using containers include:

2. Consistency: Ensures applications run the same way across different environments, reducing compatibility issues.
   
3. Isolation: Each container operates independently, preventing changes or issues in one container from affecting others.
   
4. Resource Efficiency: Containers share the host OS kernel, reducing overhead and improving resource utilization compared to traditional virtual machines.
   
5. By leveraging Docker, ECS, and ECR, you can simplify the deployment process, improve scalability, and enhance the overall management of your dynamic website on AWS.


## Objectives
Building on our previous series, "PROJECT-2: Hosting a Dynamic Website on AWS-LAMP Stack Framework," this project explores the use of Docker containers, ECS, and ECR to streamline deployment, improve scalability, and enhance management of dynamic websites on AWS. These technologies offer greater flexibility, allowing developers to package applications and dependencies into lightweight, portable containers that can be easily deployed and managed in the AWS cloud.

By the end of this project, you will have a comprehensive understanding of how to leverage Docker, ECS, and ECR to build and deploy dynamic websites on AWS efficiently.

## Cleaning Up Your ECS Project

Remove resources to avoid unnecessary charges.
After completing the setup and deployment steps, your dynamic website will be accessible via the domain you registered. The website is hosted on AWS using Docker containers managed by ECS, ensuring scalability and reliability.

To access your website:

Open your web browser.
Navigate to your registered domain name (e.g., www.yourdomain.com).
Verify that the website is loading correctly and functions as expected.

Cleanup
To avoid incurring charges for the AWS resources used in this project, follow these cleanup steps:

Delete ECS Services and Clusters

Remove ECS services and clusters via the AWS Management Console.
Delete ECR Repositories

Remove Docker images and ECR repositories.
Terminate EC2 Instances

Stop and terminate any EC2 instances created.
Delete RDS Instances

Delete the MySQL RDS instance if no longer needed.
Remove S3 Buckets

Delete S3 buckets used for storing environment files.
Delete Load Balancers and SSL Certificates

Remove Application Load Balancers and associated SSL certificates.
Delete VPC and Related Networking Components

Remove the VPC, subnets, NAT gateways, and security groups.
Remove Domain Registration

If you no longer need the domain, delete it from Route 53.
